#Sparta-Fizzbuzz

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

## Deliverables

* Must be OOP
* Must be developed with a TDD approach
* Must be testable
* Must have  a README.md with instructions on how to run the code

## instructions
The file /lib/fizzbuzz.rb contains the functionality to be tested. It can be run by initializing a new FizzBuzz object with:

  `myVar = FizzBuzz.new`

Then using the gen_numbers method to fill an array with the values:

  `myVar.gen_numbers`

  Then using return_numbers to view the current array:

  `myVar.return_numbers`
